# The task involved creating a TODO list from scratch using HTML, CSS AND JavaScript.

## I was able to successfull create my TODO list which has the functionalities stated below
 - Input new Task
 - Reset the input field to empty after adding a task
 - Ensure blank spaces are not added to the list.
 - Edit task
 - Delete task
 - Clear All tasks

## I was also suppose to ensure the data was saved to local storage so that when the page is refreshed the tasks are still visible. Unfortunately I am currently unable to acheive it perfectly.
